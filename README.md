# Smaller/Miscellanious Programs 
A section of my portfolio where I have made smaller, less impressionable programs.

# [Palindrome Finder - Integer - C++](https://github.com/DerkyJerky32/Misc-and-Smaller-Programs/blob/master/PalindromeFinderInteger.cpp "Derrick Demers - Palindrome (Integer)")
This small program gets an integer from the user and then figures out if the integer
is a palindrome number (number the same forwards and back)

# [Palindrome Finder - String - C++](https://github.com/DerkyJerky32/Misc-and-Smaller-Programs/blob/master/PalindromeFinderString.cpp "Derrick Demers - Palindrome (String)")
This simple program gets a word from the user and checks to see if it is a palindrome
